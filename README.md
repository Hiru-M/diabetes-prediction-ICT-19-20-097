Neural Network Model Development for Diabetes Prediction

This project is an assignment for the ICT4302 - Intelligent Systems. It uses a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras to predict the likelihood of diabetes using the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset.

##  Project Overview

- Goal: Predict whether a person has diabetes based on health-related features (e.g., Glucose level, BMI, Age).
- Model: Feedforward neural network with two hidden layers.
- Dataset: Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset.
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Loss curves, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Classification Report.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow 2.11
- Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
